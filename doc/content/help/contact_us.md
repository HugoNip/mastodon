# Contact Us

## Mailing list

The best way to contact the MASTODON team is through the [mastodon-users google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/mastodon-users).

To join the group, GMail users can just click the "Join group" button.
Non-GMail users must send an email to:

[mastodon-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com](mailto:mastodon-users+subscribe@googlegroups.com)

!alert! note
INL users using their `inl.gov` email will not be able to post in the group,
but will be able to receive emails and view existing posts. Instead, they can
create new posts by sending an email to
[mastodon-users@googlegroups.com](mailto:mastodon-users@googlegroups.com).
Alternatively, they can join this group using a non-INL email address.
!alert-end!
