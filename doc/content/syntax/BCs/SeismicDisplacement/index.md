# SeismicDisplacement Syntax

The input file syntax for SeismicDisplacement with the the `[BCs]` block provides
syntax for creating the correct [PresetDisplacement](/NonReflectingBC.md) boundary
conditions for each direction components specified.

If the ground excitation was measured at a depth within the soil by placing an accelerometer at that
location, then it is termed as a within-soil input. This time history contains the wave that was
generated by the earthquake (incoming wave) and the wave that is reflected off the free surface.
This ground excitation is applied as a prescribed displacement boundary condition. The
`input_function` in this case should be the displacement time histories.

## Example Usage

!listing test/tests/bcs/seismic_displacement/seismic_displacement.i block=BCs

!syntax parameters /BCs/SeismicDisplacement/SeismicDisplacementAction
