#SeismicInput System

## Description
There are two ways in which seismic ground excitation can be given as input to the soil domain. 

1. If the ground excitation was measured at a depth within the soil by placing a accelerometer at that location, then it is termed as a within-soil input. This time history contains the wave that was generated by the earthquake (incoming wave) and the wave that is reflected off the free surface. This ground excitation is applied as a prescribed displacement boundary condition and this is the default option. The input_function in this case should be the displacement time histories.

2. In some cases, the ground excitation is measured at a rock outcrop (where rock is found at surface level and there is no soil above it). To apply this to a location where rock is say $10$m deep and there is soil above it, a sideset is created at $10$m depth and the ground excitation (converted into a stress) is applied at this depth. To apply ground excitation as a stress, the input function should be given as ground velocity and "outcrop" should be set to true. More details about the conversion of ground velocity to stress can be found in /BCs/SeismicForce.
