In some cases, the ground excitation is measured at a rock outcrop (where rock is found at surface level and there is
no soil above it). To apply this to a location where rock is say $10$m deep and there is soil above it, a sideset is
created at $10$m depth and the ground excitation (converted into a stress) is applied at this depth. To apply ground
excitation as a stress, the input function should be given as ground velocity. More
details about the conversion of ground velocity to stress can be found in [SeismicForce](mastodon/SeismicForce.md).
