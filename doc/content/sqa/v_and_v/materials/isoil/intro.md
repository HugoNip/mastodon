## Introduction id=intro

MASTODON employs a nonlinear hysteretic constitutive model for soils called I-Soil ([!citet](numanoglu2017phd)). The general theory for this model is described in the [MASTODON Theory Manual](manuals/theory/index.md#isoil-theory). This page outlines procedures for the analytical verification of the different parameters involved in the MASTODON implementation of I-Soil. MASTODON is capable of generating stress-strain backbone curves for soils using different material models. Currently, these models are [User-defined](#user-defined), [Darendeli](#darendeli), and [General Quadratic/Hyperbolic (GQ/H)](#gqh). It is also possible to model the dependency on pressure of many soils, which affects both the stiffness and the strength of a soil. Comparisons between analytical solutions and the results from test files created in MASTODON are presented below for all backbone curve types and the parameters which control both stiffness and strength [pressure dependency](#pressure-dependency).
