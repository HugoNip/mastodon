# Newmark Time Integration Validation

## Problem Statement and Results
In this one element test, the base of the 2D element is fixed in both x and y
directions. The top of the block is also fixed in the y direction and a sawtooth
acceleration is applied in the x direction.

The prescribed acceleration is integrated in time using Newmark time integration.
For $\beta = 0.25$ and $\gamma = 0.5$ and timestep of 1.0 sec., the displacement and velocity
are as given in \ref{newmark-disp-vel-accel}. The interactive results shown in
\ref{newmark-diffchart} compare the analytical result ("previous") with the result computed
from MASTODON for this problem ("current").
