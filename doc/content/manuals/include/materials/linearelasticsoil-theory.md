#### Linear elastic constitutive model

In scenarios where the material exhibits a linear relation between stress and strain, and does not
retain any residual strain after unloading, is called a linear elastic material. In linear
elasticity, the stress tensor ($\sigma$) is calculated as $\sigma = \mathcal{C}\epsilon$, where
$\mathcal{C}$ is the elasticity tensor, and $\epsilon$ is the strain tensor. This material model is
currently used for numerically modeling the behavior of concrete and other materials used for
designing a structure in MASTODON.
