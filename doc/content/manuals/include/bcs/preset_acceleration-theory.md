#### Preset acceleration

If the ground excitation was measured at a depth within the soil by placing an accelerometer at that
location, then it is termed as a within-soil input. This time history contains the wave that was
generated by the earthquake (incoming wave) and the wave that is reflected off the free surface. This
ground excitation time history is usually available in the form of a acceleration time history. Since
MASTODON is a displacement controlled algorithm, i.e., displacements are the primary unknown
variables, the acceleration time history is first converted to the corresponding displacement time
history using Newmark time integration equation. This displacement time
history is then prescribed to the boundary.
