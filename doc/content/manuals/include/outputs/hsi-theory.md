#### Housner spectrum intensity

The response spectra is very useful for understanding the response of the system at one
location. However, if the response at multiple locations have to be compared, a single value that can
summarize the response at a location is much more useful. Housner spectrum intensity is the integral
of the velocity response spectra between 0.25-2.5 s (or 0.4-4 Hz). This packs the information from
the velocity response spectra at multiple frequencies into a single value and reasonably represents
the response at a location.
