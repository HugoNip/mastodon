### Response history mean

In MASTODON, the mean response history given the response histories of the same type
(i.e., displacements, velocities, or accelerations) at a list of nodes or a boundary
can be requested as an output. The mean response history can help understanding
how intense the response is, in an average sense, at a certain depth in the soil,
 or at the foundation, or at a certain height of the nuclear power plant, etc.
