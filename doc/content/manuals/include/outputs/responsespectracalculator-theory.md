#### Response spectra

An important quantity that is used in understanding the response of a structure is the
velocity/acceleration response spectra. This contains information about the frequency content of the
velocity/acceleration at a particular location. The velocity/acceleration response spectra at a
frequency $\omega$ is obtained by exciting a single degree of freedom (SDOF) system with natural
frequency of $\omega$ with the velocity/acceleration time history recorded at that location, and
obtaining the peak velocity/acceleration experienced by the SDOF. This exercise is repeated for
multiple frequencies to obtain the full response spectra.
