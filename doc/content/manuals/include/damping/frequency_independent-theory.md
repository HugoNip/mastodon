#### Frequency-independent damping

As seen in the previous sub-section, the damping ratio using Rayleigh damping varies with frequency. Although the parameters $\eta$ and $\zeta$ can be tuned to arrive at a constant damping ratio for a short frequency range, as the frequency range increases, the damping ratio no longer remains constant. For scenarios like these, where a constant damping ratio is required over a large frequency range, frequency independent damping formulations work better. This formulations is under consideration for adding to MASTODON.
