## Foundation-soil interface models id=fs_interface

The foundation-soil interface is an important aspect of NLSSI modeling. The foundation-soil interface
simulates geometric nonlinearities in the soil-structure system: gapping (opening and closing of gaps
between the soil and the foundation), sliding, and uplift.
