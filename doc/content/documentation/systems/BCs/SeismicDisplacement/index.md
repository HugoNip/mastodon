If the ground excitation was measured at a depth within the soil by placing an accelerometer at that location, then it
is termed as a within-soil input. This time history contains the wave that was generated by the earthquake (incoming
wave) and the wave that is reflected off the free surface. This ground excitation is applied as a prescribed
displacement boundary condition. The input_function in this case should be the displacement time histories.
