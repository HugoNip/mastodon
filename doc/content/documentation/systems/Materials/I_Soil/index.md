# I_Soil System

## Description
This action is used to set up the I-soil material model for different soil layers.

The I-soil material model is a nonlinear hysteretic soil model that is based on the distributed element models developed by \citet{iwan1967on} and \citet{chiang1994anew}. In 1-D, this model takes the backbone stress-strain curve and divides it into a set of elastic-perfectly plastic curves. The total stress then is the sum of the stresses from the individual elastic-perfectly plastic curves.

The three dimensional generalization of this model is achieved using von-Mises failure criteria for each elastic-perfectly plastic curve resulting in an invariant yield surfaces in three-dimensional stress space like in Figure 1.

The backbone stress-strain curves for each soil layer can be provided in three different ways:

1. User-defined backbone curve (soil_type = 0): The backbone curve can be provided in a csv file where the first column is shear strain and the second column is shear stress. The number of elastic-perfectly plastic curves that will be generated from this backbone curve depends on the number of entries in the data file. When many soil layers are present, a vector of data files can be provided as input. The size of this vector should equal the number of soil layers. Also the number of entries in each data file should be the same.

2. Darendeli backbone curve (soil_type = 1): The backbone curve can be auto-generated based on empirical data for common soil types. \citet{darendeli2001development} presents a functional form that can be used to create the backbone shear stress - strain curves based on the experimental results obtained from resonant column and torsional shear tests. This functional form requires the initial shear modulus, initial bulk modulus, plasticity index, over consolidation ratio, reference mean confining pressure (p_ref) and number of points as input. Other than the number of points, all the other parameters can be provided as a vector for each soil layer. The number of points, which determines the number of elastic-perfectly plastic curves to be generated, is constant for all soil layers.

3. General Quadratic/Hyperbolic (GQ/H) backbone curve (soil_type = 2): \citet{darendeli2001development} study constructs the shear stress-strain curves based on experimentally obtained data. At small strains the data is obtained using resonant column test, and towards the medium shear strain levels the torsional shear test results are used. The values are extrapolated at the large strain levels. This extrapolation may underestimate or overestimate the shear strength at large strains. Therefore, shear strength correction is necessary to account for the correct shear strength at large strains. GQ/H model proposed by \citet{groholski2016simplified} has a curve fitting scheme that automatically corrects the reference curves provided by \citet{darendeli2001development} based on the specific shear strength at the large strains. This model requires taumax, theta_1 through 5, initial shear modulus, initial bulk modulus and number of points as input. The parameter taumax is the maximum shear stress that can be generated in the soil. The parameters theta_1 through 5 are the curve fitting parameters and can be obtained using DEEPSOIL \citep{hashash2016deepsoil}. Other than the number of points, all the other parameters can be given as a vector for the different soil layers. The number of points, which determines the number of elastic-perfectly plastic curves to be generated, is constant for all soil layers.

All the above backbone curves provide the behavior of the soil at a reference confining pressure($p_{ref}$). When the confining pressure of the soil changes, the soil behavior also changes. The shear modulus ($G(p)$) at a pressure $p$ is given by:

$$ G(p) = G_0 (\frac{p-p_0}{p_{ref}})^{b_{exp}},$$

where $G_0$ is the initial shear modulus, $p_0$ is the tension pressure cut off and $b_{exp}$ is a parameter obtained from experiments. The shear modulus reduces to zero for any pressure lower than $p_0$ to model the failure of soil in tension. Note that compressive pressure is taken to be positive.  

Similarly, the yield stress ($\sigma_y(p)$) of the elastic-perfectly plastic curve also changes when the confining pressure changes. The yield stress ($\sigma_y(p)$) at a pressure $p$ is given as:

$$\sigma_y(p) = \sqrt{\frac{a_0 + a_1 (p-p_0) + a_2 (p-p_0)^2}{a_0 + a_1 p_{ref} + a_2 {p_{ref}}^2}} \sigma_y(p_{ref}) ,$$

where $a_0$, $a_1$ and $a_2$ are parameters obtained from experiments.

To include pressure dependent stiffness and yield strength calculation, pressure_dependency should be set to true and b_exp, a_0, a_1, a_2, tension_pressure_cut_off and p_ref need to be provided as input. Other than p_ref, all the other parameters are the same for all the soil layers. p_ref can be provided as vector with information about each soil layer.
